### Objective
>Our projectâ€™s primary concept is to utilize [Yelp Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) to predict customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction about a new business, for example, a restaurant or a bar. That is, we are going to get Yelp user review data, use reviewers' comments to predict their attitude (namely positive or negative) about the business. In another use case, when people talk about a new business, we can capture their comments, fit into our models, then predict their satisfaction or dissatisfaction about the business. We can also develop the quantitative understanding about business quality via sentiment scores, and thus we can evaluate the potential of the business accordingly. Since reviewers' comments are highly correlated with business categories, we are going to focus on bars and restaurants to avoid bias due to the differences in business types. The restaurant category also has the majority of reviews in the Yelp Kaggle dataset. Our results showed that both bars and restaurants exhibit very similar characteristics in terms of business sentiments and customer satisfactions or dissatisfactions.
