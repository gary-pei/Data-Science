# Assignment 12

## Do the following:
- Spin up the cluster with the necessary containers.
- Run your web app.
- Generate data.
- Write events & check to make sure you were successful.
- Run queries with Presto - at least Select * from <your-table-name>

### Turn in your `/assignment-12-<user-name>/README.md` file. It should include:
1) A summary type explanation of the example. 
  * For example, for Week 6's activity, a summary would be: "We spun up a cluster with kafka, zookeeper, and the mids container. Then we published and consumed messages with kafka."
2) Your `docker-compose.yml`
3) Source code for the application(s) used.
4) Each important step in the process. For each step, include:
  * The command(s) 
  * The output (if there is any).  Be sure to include examples of generated events when available.
  * An explanation for what it achieves 
    * The explanation should be fairly detailed, e.g., instead of "publish to kafka" say what you're publishing, where it's coming from, going to etc.
